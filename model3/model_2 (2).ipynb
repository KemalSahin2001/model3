    "PHYSICAL MEANING OF GEOMETRICAL PROPOSITIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "In your schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance\n",
    "with the noble building of Euclid’s geometry, and you remember—perhaps\n",
    "with more respect than love—the magnificent structure, on the lofty\n",
    "staircase of which you were chased about for uncounted hours by\n",
    "conscientious teachers. By reason of our past experience, you would\n",
    "certainly regard everyone with disdain who should pronounce even the\n",
    "most out-of-the-way proposition of this science to be untrue. But\n",
    "perhaps this feeling of proud certainty would leave you immediately if\n",
    "some one were to ask you: “What, then, do you mean by the assertion\n",
    "that these propositions are true?” Let us proceed to give this question\n",
    "a little consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometry sets out from certain conceptions such as “plane,” “point,”\n",
    "and “straight line,” with which we are able to associate more or less\n",
    "definite ideas, and from certain simple propositions (axioms) which, in\n",
    "virtue of these ideas, we are inclined to accept as “true.” Then, on\n",
    "the basis of a logical process, the justification of which we feel\n",
    "ourselves compelled to admit, all remaining propositions are shown to\n",
    "follow from those axioms, _i.e._ they are proven. A proposition is then\n",
    "correct (“true”) when it has been derived in the recognised manner from\n",
    "the axioms. The question of “truth” of the individual geometrical\n",
    "propositions is thus reduced to one of the “truth” of the axioms. Now\n",
    "it has long been known that the last question is not only unanswerable\n",
    "by the methods of geometry, but that it is in itself entirely without\n",
    "meaning. We cannot ask whether it is true that only one straight line\n",
    "goes through two points. We can only say that Euclidean geometry deals\n",
    "with things called “straight lines,” to each of which is ascribed the\n",
    "property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it. The\n",
    "concept “true” does not tally with the assertions of pure geometry,\n",
    "because by the word “true” we are eventually in the habit of\n",
    "designating always the correspondence with a “real” object; geometry,\n",
    "however, is not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in it\n",
    "to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of these\n",
    "ideas among themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not difficult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel\n",
    "constrained to call the propositions of geometry “true.” Geometrical\n",
    "ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature, and these\n",
    "last are undoubtedly the exclusive cause of the genesis of those ideas.\n",
    "Geometry ought to refrain from such a course, in order to give to its\n",
    "structure the largest possible logical unity. The practice, for\n",
    "example, of seeing in a “distance” two marked positions on a\n",
    "practically rigid body is something which is lodged deeply in our habit\n",
    "of thought. We are accustomed further to regard three points as being\n",
    "situated on a straight line, if their apparent positions can be made to\n",
    "coincide for observation with one eye, under suitable choice of our\n",
    "place of observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now supplement the\n",
    "propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two\n",
    "points on a practically rigid body always correspond to the same\n",
    "distance (line-interval), independently of any changes in position to\n",
    "which we may subject the body, the propositions of Euclidean geometry\n",
    "then resolve themselves into propositions on the possible relative\n",
    "position of practically rigid bodies.[1] Geometry which has been\n",
    "supplemented in this way is then to be treated as a branch of physics.\n",
    "We can now legitimately ask as to the “truth” of geometrical\n",
    "propositions interpreted in this way, since we are justified in asking\n",
    "whether these propositions are satisfied for those real things we have\n",
    "associated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact terms we can\n",
    "express this by saying that by the “truth” of a geometrical proposition\n",
    "in this sense we understand its validity for a construction with rule\n",
    "and compasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " [1] It follows that a natural object is associated also with a\n",
    " straight line. Three points _A, B_ and _C_ on a rigid body thus lie in\n",
    " a straight line when the points _A_ and _C_ being given, _B_ is chosen\n",
    " such that the sum of the distances _AB_ and _BC_ is as short as\n",
    " possible. This incomplete suggestion will suffice for the present\n",
    " purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the conviction of the “truth” of geometrical propositions in\n",
    "this sense is founded exclusively on rather incomplete experience. For\n",
    "the present we shall assume the “truth” of the geometrical\n",
    "propositions, then at a later stage (in the general theory of\n",

    "THE SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES\n",
    "\n",
    "On the basis of the physical interpretation of distance which has been\n",
    "indicated, we are also in a position to establish the distance between\n",
    "two points on a rigid body by means of measurements. For this purpose\n",
    "we require a “distance” (rod _S_) which is to be used once and for all,\n",
    "and which we employ as a standard measure. If, now, _A_ and _B_ are two\n",
    "points on a rigid body, we can construct the line joining them\n",
    "according to the rules of geometry; then, starting from _A_, we can\n",
    "mark off the distance _S_ time after time until we reach _B_. The\n",
    "number of these operations required is the numerical measure of the\n",
    "distance _AB_. This is the basis of all measurement of length.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " [2] Here we have assumed that there is nothing left over _i.e._ that\n",
    " the measurement gives a whole number. This difficulty is got over by\n",
    " the use of divided measuring-rods, the introduction of which does not\n",
    " demand any fundamentally new method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every description of the scene of an event or of the position of an\n",
    "object in space is based on the specification of the point on a rigid\n",
    "body (body of reference) with which that event or object coincides.\n",
    "This applies not only to scientific description, but also to everyday\n",
    "life. If I analyse the place specification “Trafalgar Square,\n",
    "London”[3] I arrive at the following result. The earth is the rigid\n",
    "body to which the specification of place refers; “Trafalgar Square,\n",
    "London” is a well-defined point, to which a name has been assigned, and\n",
    "with which the event coincides in space.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " [3]\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen this as being more familiar to the English reader than\n",
    "the “Potzdammer Platz, Berlin,” which is referred to in the original.\n",
    "(R. W. L.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " [4] It is not necessary here to investigate further the significance\n",
    " of the expression “coincidence in space.” This conception is\n",
    " sufficiently obvious to ensure that differences of opinion are\n",
    " scarcely likely to arise as to its applicability in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This primitive method of place specification deals only with places on\n",
    "the surface of rigid bodies, and is dependent on the existence of\n",
    "points on this surface which are distinguishable from each other. But\n",
    "we can free ourselves from both of these limitations without altering\n",
    "the nature of our specification of position. If, for instance, a cloud\n",
    "is hovering over Trafalgar Square, then we can determine its position\n",
    "relative to the surface of the earth by erecting a pole perpendicularly\n",
    "on the Square, so that it reaches the cloud. The length of the pole\n",
    "measured with the standard measuring-rod, combined with the\n",
    "specification of the position of the foot of the pole, supplies us with\n",
    "a complete place specification. On the basis of this illustration, we\n",
    "are able to see the manner in which a refinement of the conception of\n",
    "position has been developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "(_a_) We imagine the rigid body, to which the place specification is\n",
    "referred, supplemented in such a manner that the object whose position\n",
    "we require is reached by the completed rigid body.\n",
    "\n",
    "(_b_) In locating the position of the object, we make use of a number\n",
    "(here the length of the pole measured with the measuring-rod) instead\n",
    "of designated points of reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "(_c_) We speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole which\n",
    "reaches the cloud has not been erected. By means of optical\n",
    "observations of the cloud from different positions on the ground, and\n",
    "taking into account the properties of the propagation of light, we\n",
    "determine the length of the pole we should have required in order to\n",
    "reach the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this consideration we see that it will be advantageous if, in the\n",
    "description of position, it should be possible by means of numerical\n",
    "measures to make ourselves independent of the existence of marked\n",
    "positions (possessing names) on the rigid body of reference. In the\n",
    "physics of measurement this is attained by the application of the\n",
    "Cartesian system of co-ordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This consists of three plane surfaces perpendicular to each other and\n",
    "rigidly attached to a rigid body. Referred to a system of co-ordinates,\n",
    "the scene of any event will be determined (for the main part) by the\n",
    "specification of the lengths of the three perpendiculars or\n",
    "co-ordinates (_x, y, z_) which can be dropped from the scene of the\n",
    "event to those three plane surfaces. The lengths of these three\n",
    "perpendiculars can be determined by a series of manipulations with\n",
    "rigid measuring-rods performed according to the rules and methods laid\n",
    "down by Euclidean geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the rigid surfaces which constitute the system of\n",
    "co-ordinates are generally not available; furthermore, the magnitudes\n",
    "of the co-ordinates are not actually determined by constructions with\n",
    "rigid rods, but by indirect means. If the results of physics and\n",
    "astronomy are to maintain their clearness, the physical meaning of\n",
    "specifications of position must always be sought in accordance with the\n",
    "above considerations.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " [5] A refinement and modification of these views does not become\n",
    " necessary until we come to deal with the general theory of relativity,\n",
    " treated in the second part of this book.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus obtain the following result: Every description of events in\n",
    "space involves the use of a rigid body to which such events have to be\n",
    "referred. The resulting relationship takes for granted that the laws of\n",
    "Euclidean geometry hold for “distances;” the “distance” being\n",
    "represented physically by means of the convention of two marks on a\n",
    "rigid body.\n",

    "SPACE AND TIME IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their\n",
    "position in space with “time.” I should load my conscience with grave\n",
    "sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate the aims\n",
    "of mechanics in this way, without serious reflection and detailed\n",
    "explanations. Let us proceed to disclose these sins.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not clear what is to be understood here by “position” and\n",
    "“space.” I stand at the window of a railway carriage which is\n",
    "travelling uniformly, and drop a stone on the embankment, without\n",
    "throwing it. Then, disregarding the influence of the air resistance, I\n",
    "see the stone descend in a straight line. A pedestrian who observes the\n",
    "misdeed from the footpath notices that the stone falls to earth in a\n",
    "parabolic curve. I now ask: Do the “positions” traversed by the stone\n",
    "lie “in reality” on a straight line or on a parabola? Moreover, what is\n",
    "meant here by motion “in space”? From the considerations of the\n",
    "previous section the answer is self-evident. In the first place we\n",
    "entirely shun the vague word “space,” of which, we must honestly\n",
    "acknowledge, we cannot form the slightest conception, and we replace it\n",
    "by “motion relative to a practically rigid body of reference.” The\n",
    "positions relative to the body of reference (railway carriage or\n",
    "embankment) have already been defined in detail in the preceding\n",
    "section. If instead of “body of reference” we insert “system of\n",
    "co-ordinates,” which is a useful idea for mathematical description, we\n",
    "are in a position to say: The stone traverses a straight line relative\n",
    "to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the carriage, but\n",
    "relative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the ground\n",
    "(embankment) it describes a parabola. With the aid of this example it\n",
    "is clearly seen that there is no such thing as an independently\n",

    "\n",

    " [6] That is, a curve along which the body moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have a _complete_ description of the motion, we must\n",
    "specify how the body alters its position _with time; i.e._ for every\n",
    "point on the trajectory it must be stated at what time the body is\n",
    "situated there. These data must be supplemented by such a definition of\n",
    "time that, in virtue of this definition, these time-values can be\n",
    "regarded essentially as magnitudes (results of measurements) capable of\n",
    "observation. If we take our stand on the ground of classical mechanics,\n",
    "we can satisfy this requirement for our illustration in the following\n",
    "manner. We imagine two clocks of identical construction; the man at the\n",
    "railway-carriage window is holding one of them, and the man on the\n",
    "footpath the other. Each of the observers determines the position on\n",
    "his own reference-body occupied by the stone at each tick of the clock\n",
    "he is holding in his hand. In this connection we have not taken account\n",
    "of the inaccuracy involved by the finiteness of the velocity of\n",
    "propagation of light. With this and with a second difficulty prevailing\n",
    "here we shall have to deal in detail later.\n",

    "IV. THE GALILEIAN SYSTEM OF CO-ORDINATES\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As is well known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of\n",
    "Galilei-Newton, which is known as the _law of inertia_, can be stated\n",
    "thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a\n",
    "state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. This law not\n",
    "only says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also\n",
    "indicates the reference-bodies or systems of coordinates, permissible\n",
    "in mechanics, which can be used in mechanical description. The visible\n",
    "fixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to\n",
    "a high degree of approximation. Now if we use a system of co-ordinates\n",
    "which is rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system,\n",
    "every fixed star describes a circle of immense radius in the course of\n",
    "an astronomical day, a result which is opposed to the statement of the\n",
    "law of inertia. So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these\n",
    "motions only to systems of coordinates relative to which the fixed\n",
    "stars do not move in a circle. A system of co-ordinates of which the\n",
    "state of motion is such that the law of inertia holds relative to it is\n",
    "called a “Galileian system of co-ordinates.” The laws of the mechanics\n",
    "of Galilei-Newton can be regarded as valid only for a Galileian system\n",
    "of co-ordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "V.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY (IN THE RESTRICTED SENSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to attain the greatest possible clearness, let us return to\n",
    "our example of the railway carriage supposed to be travelling\n",
    "uniformly. We call its motion a uniform translation (“uniform” because\n",
    "it is of constant velocity and direction, “translation” because\n",
    "although the carriage changes its position relative to the embankment\n",
    "yet it does not rotate in so doing). Let us imagine a raven flying\n",
    "through the air in such a manner that its motion, as observed from the\n",
    "embankment, is uniform and in a straight line. If we were to observe\n",
    "the flying raven from the moving railway carriage. we should find that\n",
    "the motion of the raven would be one of different velocity and\n",
    "direction, but that it would still be uniform and in a straight line.\n",
    "Expressed in an abstract manner we may say: If a mass _m_ is moving\n",
    "uniformly in a straight line with respect to a co-ordinate system _K_,\n",
    "then it will also be moving uniformly and in a straight line relative\n",
    "to a second co-ordinate system _K′_ provided that the latter is\n",
    "executing a uniform translatory motion with respect to _K_. In\n",
    "accordance with the discussion contained in the preceding section, it\n",
    "follows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "If _K_ is a Galileian co-ordinate system. then every other co-ordinate\n",
    "system _K′_ is a Galileian one, when, in relation to _K_, it is in a\n",
    "condition of uniform motion of translation. Relative to _K′_ the\n",
    "mechanical laws of Galilei-Newton hold good exactly as they do with\n",
    "respect to _K_.\n",
    "\n",
    "We advance a step farther in our generalisation when we express the\n",
    "tenet thus: If, relative to _K_, _K′_ is a uniformly moving co-ordinate\n",
    "system devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena run their course with\n",
    "respect to _K′_ according to exactly the same general laws as with\n",
    "respect to _K_. This statement is called the _principle of relativity_\n",
    "(in the restricted sense).\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as one was convinced that all natural phenomena were capableof\n",
    "representation with the help of classical mechanics, there was no need\n",
    "to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity. But in view of\n",
    "the more recent development of electrodynamics and optics it became\n",
    "more and more evident that classical mechanics affords an insufficient\n",
    "foundation for the physical description of all natural phenomena. At\n",
    "this juncture the question of the validity of the principle of\n",
    "relativity became ripe for discussion, and it did not appear impossible\n",
    "that the answer to this question might be in the negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset speak\n",
    "very much in favour of the validity of the principle of relativity.\n",
    "Even though classical mechanics does not supply us with a sufficiently\n",
    "broad basis for the theoretical presentation of all physical phenomena,\n",
    "still we must grant it a considerable measure of “truth,” since it\n",
    "supplies us with the actual motions of the heavenly bodies with a\n",
    "delicacy of detail little short of wonderful. The principle of\n",
    "relativity must therefore apply with great accuracy in the domain of\n",
    "_mechanics_. But that a principle of such broad generality should hold\n",
    "with such exactness in one domain of phenomena, and yet should be\n",
    "invalid for another, is _a priori_ not very probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now proceed to the second argument, to which, moreover, we shall\n",
    "return later. If the principle of relativity (in the restricted sense)\n",
    "does not hold, then the Galileian co-ordinate systems _K, K′, K″_,\n",
    "etc., which are moving uniformly relative to each other, will not be\n",
    "_equivalent_ for the description of natural phenomena. In this case we\n",
    "should be constrained to believe that natural laws are capable of being\n",
    "formulated in a particularly simple manner, and of course only on\n",
    "condition that, from amongst all possible Galileian co-ordinate\n",
    "systems, we should have chosen _one_ (_K0_) of a particular state of\n",
    "motion as our body of reference. We should then be justified (because\n",
    "of its merits for the description of natural phenomena) in calling this\n",
    "system “absolutely at rest,” and all other Galileian systems _K_ “in\n",
    "motion.” If, for instance, our embankment were the system _K0_ then our\n",
    "railway carriage would be a system _K_, relative to which less simple\n",
    "laws would hold than with respect to _K0_. This diminished simplicity\n",
    "would be due to the fact that the carriage _K_ would be in motion\n",
    "(_i.e._ “really”)with respect to _K0_. In the general laws of nature\n",
    "which have been formulated with reference to _K_, the magnitude and\n",
    "direction of the velocity of the carriage would necessarily play a\n",
    "part. We should expect, for instance, that the note emitted by an\n",
    "organpipe placed with its axis parallel to the direction of travel\n",
    "would be different from that emitted if the axis of the pipe were\n",
    "placed perpendicular to this direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the sun, our earth is\n",
    "comparable with a railway carriage travelling with a velocity of about\n",
    "30 kilometres per second. If the principle of relativity were not valid\n",
    "we should therefore expect that the direction of motion of the earth at\n",
    "any moment would enter into the laws of nature, and also that physical\n",
    "systems in their behaviour would be dependent on the orientation in\n",
    "space with respect to the earth. For owing to the alteration in\n",
    "direction of the velocity of revolution of the earth in the course of a\n",
    "year, the earth cannot be at rest relative to the hypothetical system\n",
    "_K0_ throughout the whole year. However, the most careful observations\n",
    "have never revealed such anisotropic properties in terrestrial physical\n",
    "space, _i.e._ a physical non-equivalence of different directions. This\n",

    "that this velocity of propagation is dependent on the direction “in\n",

    "travelling along the railway lines with the velocity _v_, and that its\n",
    "direction is the same as that of the ray of light, but its velocity of\n",
    "course much less. Let us inquire about the velocity of propagation of\n",
    "the ray of light relative to the carriage. It is obvious that we can\n",

    "light plays the part of the man walking along relatively to the\n",
    "carriage. The velocity _W_ of the man relative to the embankment is\n",
    "here replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment. _w_\n",
    "is the required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and we\n",

    "\n",
    "The velocity of propagation ot a ray of light relative to the carriage\n",
    "thus comes out smaller than _c_.\n",

    "\n",
    "In view of this dilemma there appears to be nothing else for it than to\n",
    "abandon either the principle of relativity or the simple law of the\n",
    "propagation of light _in vacuo_. Those of you who have carefully\n",

    "of ingenious considerations an able meteorologist were to discover that\n",
    "the lightning must always strike the places _A_ and _B_ simultaneously,\n",

    "particular point of the train. Also the definition of simultaneity can\n",
    "be given relative to the train in exactly the same way as with respect\n",
    "to the embankment. As a natural consequence, however, the following\n",
    "question arises:\n",
    "\n",
    "image001\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Are two events (_e.g._ the two strokes of lightning _A_ and _B_) which\n",
    "are simultaneous _with reference to the railway embankment_ also\n",
    "simultaneous _relatively to the train?_ We shall show directly that the\n",
    "answer must be in the negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say that the lightning strokes _A_ and _B_ are simultaneous\n",
    "with respect to be embankment, we mean: the rays of light emitted at\n",
    "the places _A_ and _B_, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at\n",
    "the mid-point _M_ of the length _A_ → _B_ of the embankment. But the\n",
    "events _A_ and _B_ also correspond to positions _A_ and _B_ on the\n",
    "train. Let _M′_ be the mid-point of the distance _A_ → _B_ on the\n",
    "travelling train. Just when the flashes (as judged from the embankment)\n",
    "of lightning occur, this point _M′_ naturally coincides with the point\n",
    "_M_ but it moves towards the right in the diagram with the velocity v\n",
    "of the train. If an observer sitting in the position _M′_ in the train\n",
    "did not possess this velocity, then he would remain permanently at M,\n",
    "and the light rays emitted by the flashes of lightning _A_ and _B_\n",
    "would reach him simultaneously, _i.e._ they would meet just where he is\n",
    "situated. Now in reality (considered with reference to the railway\n",
    "embankment) he is hastening towards the beam of light coming from _B_,\n",
    "whilst he is riding on ahead of the beam of light coming from _A_.\n",
    "Hence the observer will see the beam of light emitted from _B_ earlier\n",
    "than he will see that emitted from _A_. Observers who take the railway\n",
    "train as their reference-body must therefore come to the conclusion\n",
    "that the lightning flash _B_ took place earlier than the lightning\n",

    "Events which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not\n",
    "simultaneous with respect to the train, and _vice versa_ (relativity of\n",

    "the body of reference. But we have just seen that this assumption is\n",
    "incompatible with the most natural definition of simultaneity; if we\n",
    "discard this assumption, then the conflict between the law of the\n",

    "distance can be measured up. It is the simplest plan to use the train\n",
    "itself as reference-body (co-ordinate system). An observer in the train\n",
    "measures the interval by marking off his measuring-rod in a straight\n",
    "line (_e.g._ along the floor of the carriage) as many times as is\n",
    "necessary to take him from the one marked point to the other. Then the\n",

    "question leads to a general one. In the discussion of Section VI we\n",

    "relation to the train, when we know the place and time of the event\n",

    "Before we deal with this, we shall introduce the following incidental\n",
    "consideration. Up to the present we have only considered events taking\n",
    "place along the embankment, which had mathematically to assume the\n",
    "function of a straight line. In the manner indicated in Section II we\n",

    "event, no matter how far off it may be, could also be localised with\n",
    "respect to the second framework. Without committing any fundamental\n",
    "error, we can disregard the fact that in reality these frameworks would\n",

    "solid bodies. In every such framework we imagine three surfaces\n",
    "perpendicular to each other marked out, and designated as “co-ordinate\n",

    "Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would have been\n",
    "generally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less\n",
    "unequivocally in its favour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical mechanics required to be modified before it could come into\n",
    "line with the demands of the special theory of relativity. For the main\n",
    "part, however, this modification affects only the laws for rapid\n",
    "motions, in which the velocities of matter _v_ are not very small as\n",
    "compared with the velocity of light. We have experience of such rapid\n",
    "motions only in the case of electrons and ions; for other motions the\n",
    "variations from the laws of classical mechanics are too small to make\n",
    "themselves evident in practice. We shall not consider the motion of\n",
    "stars until we come to speak of the general theory of relativity. In\n",
    "accordance with the theory of relativity the kinetic energy of a\n",

    "a state of uniform motion of translation relative to _K_, or, briefly,\n",

    "SPECIAL AND GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY\n",

    "The basal principle, which was the pivot of all our previous\n",

    "principle of the physical relativity of all _uniform_ motion. Let as\n",
    "once more analyse its meaning carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was at all times clear that, from the point of view of the idea it\n",
    "conveys to us, every motion must be considered only as a relative\n",
    "motion. Returning to the illustration we have frequently used of the\n",
    "embankment and the railway carriage, we can express the fact of the\n",
    "motion here taking place in the following two forms, both of which are\n",
    "equally justifiable:\n",
    "\n",
    "(_a_) The carriage is in motion relative to the embankment,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(_b_) The embankment is in motion relative to the carriage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In (_a_) the embankment, in (_b_) the carriage, serves as the body of\n",
    "reference in our statement of the motion taking place. If it is simply\n",
    "a question of detecting or of describing the motion involved, it is in\n",
    "principle immaterial to what reference-body we refer the motion. As\n",
    "already mentioned, this is self-evident, but it must not be confused\n",
    "with the much more comprehensive statement called “the principle of\n",
    "relativity,” which we have taken as the basis of our investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle we have made use of not only maintains that we may\n",
    "equally well choose the carriage or the embankment as our\n",
    "reference-body for the description of any event (for this, too, is\n",
    "self-evident). Our principle rather asserts what follows: If we\n",
    "formulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained from\n",
    "experience, by making use of\n",
    "\n",
    "(_a_) the embankment as reference-body,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(_b_) the railway carriage as reference-body,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "then these general laws of nature (_e.g._ the laws of mechanics or the\n",
    "law of the propagation of light _in vacuo_) have exactly the same form\n",
    "in both cases. This can also be expressed as follows: For the physical\n",
    "description of natural processes, neither of the reference bodies _K,\n",
    "K′_ is unique (lit. “specially marked out”) as compared with the other.\n",
    "Unlike the first, this latter statement need not of necessity hold _a\n",
    "priori;_ it is not contained in the conceptions of “motion” and\n",
    "“reference-body” and derivable from them; only _experience_ can decide\n",
    "as to its correctness or incorrectness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to the present, however, we have by no means maintained the\n",
    "equivalence of _all_ bodies of reference _K_ in connection with the\n",
    "formulation of natural laws. Our course was more on the following\n",
    "Iines. In the first place, we started out from the assumption that\n",
    "there exists a reference-body _K_, whose condition of motion is such\n",
    "that the Galileian law holds with respect to it: A particle left to\n",
    "itself and sufficiently far removed from all other particles moves\n",
    "uniformly in a straight line. With reference to K (Galileian\n",
    "reference-body) the laws of nature were to be as simple as possible.\n",
    "But in addition to K, all bodies of reference _K′_ should be given\n",
    "preference in this sense, and they should be exactly equivalent to _K_\n",
    "for the formulation of natural laws, provided that they are in a state\n",
    "of _uniform rectilinear and non-rotary motion_ with respect to _K_; all\n",
    "these bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian\n",
    "reference-bodies. The validity of the principle of relativity was\n",
    "assumed only for these reference-bodies, but not for others (_e.g._\n",
    "those possessing motion of a different kind). In this sense we speak of\n",
    "the _special_ principle of relativity, or special theory of relativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to this we wish to understand by the “general principle of\n",
    "relativity” the following statement: All bodies of reference _K, K′_,\n",
    "etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena\n",
    "(formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their\n",
    "state of motion. But before proceeding farther, it ought to be pointed\n",
    "out that this formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract\n",
    "one, for reasons which will become evident at a later stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the introduction of the special principle of relativity has been\n",
    "justified, every intellect which strives after generalisation must feel\n",
    "the temptation to venture the step towards the general principle of\n",
    "relativity. But a simple and apparently quite reliable consideration\n",
    "seems to suggest that, for the present at any rate, there is little\n",
    "hope of success in such an attempt; Let us imagine ourselves\n",
    "transferred to our old friend the railway carriage, which is travelling\n",
    "at a uniform rate. As long as it is moving uniformly, the occupant of\n",
    "the carriage is not sensible of its motion, and it is for this reason\n",
    "that he can without reluctance interpret the facts of the case as\n",
    "indicating that the carriage is at rest, but the embankment in motion.\n",
    "Moreover, according to the special principle of relativity, this\n",
    "interpretation is quite justified also from a physical point of view.\n",
    "If the motion of the carriage is now changed into a non-uniform motion,\n",
    "as for instance by a powerful application of the brakes, then the\n",
    "occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful jerk\n",
    "forwards. The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical behaviour\n",
    "of bodies relative to the person in the railway carriage. The\n",
    "mechanical behaviour is different from that of the case previously\n",
    "considered, and for this reason it would appear to be impossible that\n",
    "the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving\n",
    "carriage, as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in\n",
    "uniform motion. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does\n",
    "not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of\n",
    "this, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of\n",
    "absolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the\n",
    "general principle of relativity. But in what follows we shall soon see\n",

    "THE GRAVITATIONAL FIELD\n",
    "\n",
    "“If we pick up a stone and then let it go, why does it fall to the\n",
    "ground?” The usual answer to this question is: “Because it is attracted\n",
    "by the earth.” Modern physics formulates the answer rather differently\n",
    "for the following reason. As a result of the more careful study of\n",
    "electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to regard action at a distance\n",
    "as a process impossible without the intervention of some intermediary\n",
    "medium. If, for instance, a magnet attracts a piece of iron, we cannot\n",
    "be content to regard this as meaning that the magnet acts directly on\n",
    "the iron through the intermediate empty space, but we are constrained\n",
    "to imagine—after the manner of Faraday—that the magnet always calls\n",
    "into being something physically real in the space around it, that\n",
    "something being what we call a “magnetic field.” In its turn this\n",
    "magnetic field operates on the piece of iron, so that the latter\n",
    "strives to move towards the magnet. We shall not discuss here the\n",
    "justification for this incidental conception, which is indeed a\n",
    "somewhat arbitrary one. We shall only mention that with its aid\n",
    "electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented much more\n",
    "satisfactorily than without it, and this applies particularly to the\n",
    "transmission of electromagnetic waves. The effects of gravitation also\n",
    "are regarded in an analogous manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The action of the earth on the stone takes place indirectly. The earth\n",
    "produces in its surrounding a gravitational field, which acts on the\n",
    "stone and produces its motion of fall. As we know from experience, the\n",
    "intensity of the action on a body dimishes according to a quite\n",
    "definite law, as we proceed farther and farther away from the earth.\n",
    "From our point of view this means: The law governing the properties of\n",
    "the gravitational field in space must be a perfectly definite one, in\n",
    "order correctly to represent the diminution of gravitational action\n",
    "with the distance from operative bodies. It is something like this: The\n",
    "body (_e.g._ the earth) produces a field in its immediate neighbourhood\n",
    "directly; the intensity and direction of the field at points farther\n",
    "removed from the body are thence determined by the law which governs\n",
    "the properties in space of the gravitational fields themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to electric and magnetic fields, the gravitational field\n",
    "exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of fundamental importance\n",
    "for what follows. Bodies which are moving under the sole influence of a\n",
    "gravitational field receive an acceleration, _which does not in the\n",
    "least depend either on the material or on the physical state of the\n",
    "body._ For instance, a piece of lead and a piece of wood fall in\n",
    "exactly the same manner in a gravitational field (_in vacuo_), when\n",
    "they start off from rest or with the same initial velocity. This law,\n",
    "which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form in\n",
    "the light of the following consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Newton’s law of motion, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "(Force) = (inertial mass) x (acceleration),\n",
    "\n",
    "where the “inertial mass” is a characteristic constant of the\n",
    "accelerated body. If now gravitation is the cause of the acceleration,\n",
    "we then have\n",
    "\n",
    "(Force) = (gravitational mass) x (intensity of the gravitational\n",
    "field),\n",
    "\n",
    "where the “gravitational mass” is likewise a characteristic constant\n",
    "for the body. From these two relations follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "image032\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If now, as we find from experience, the acceleration is to be\n",
    "independent of the nature and the condition of the body and always the\n",
    "same for a given gravitational field, then the ratio of the\n",
    "gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same for all\n",
    "bodies. By a suitable choice of units we can thus make this ratio equal\n",
    "to unity. We then have the following law: The _gravitational_ mass of a\n",
    "body is equal to its _inertial_ mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded in\n",

    "We imagine a large portion of empty space, so far removed from stars\n",
    "and other appreciable masses, that we have before us approximately the\n",
    "conditions required by the fundamental law of Galilei. It is then\n",
    "possible to choose a Galileian reference-body for this part of space\n",
    "(world), relative to which points at rest remain at rest and points in\n",
    "motion continue permanently in uniform rectilinear motion. As\n",
    "reference-body let us imagine a spacious chest resembling a room with\n",
    "an observer inside who is equipped with apparatus. Gravitation\n",
    "naturally does not exist for this observer. He must fasten himself with\n",
    "strings to the floor, otherwise the slightest impact against the floor\n",
    "will cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "To the middle of the lid of the chest is fixed externally a hook with\n",
    "rope attached, and now a “being” (what kind of a being is immaterial to\n",
    "us) begins pulling at this with a constant force. The chest together\n",
    "with the observer then begin to move “upwards” with a uniformly\n",
    "accelerated motion. In course of time their velocity will reach\n",
    "unheard-of values—provided that we are viewing all this from another\n",
    "reference-body which is not being pulled with a rope.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does the man in the chest regard the Process? The acceleration\n",
    "of the chest will be transmitted to him by the reaction of the floor of\n",
    "the chest. He must therefore take up this pressure by means of his legs\n",
    "if he does not wish to be laid out full length on the floor. He is then\n",
    "standing in the chest in exactly the same way as anyone stands in a\n",
    "room of a home on our earth. If he releases a body which he previously\n",
    "had in his land, the accelertion of the chest will no longer be\n",
    "transmitted to this body, and for this reason the body will approach\n",
    "the floor of the chest with an accelerated relative motion. The\n",
    "observer will further convince himself _that the acceleration of the\n",
    "body towards the floor of the chest is always of the same magnitude,\n",
    "whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the experiment._\n",
    "\n",
    "Relying on his knowledge of the gravitational field (as it was\n",
    "discussed in the preceding section), the man in the chest will thus\n",
    "come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational\n",
    "field which is constant with regard to time. Of course he will be\n",
    "puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not fall in this\n",
    "gravitational field. just then, however, he discovers the hook in the\n",
    "middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which is attached to it,\n",
    "and he consequently comes to the conclusion that the chest is suspended\n",
    "at rest in the gravitational field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion? I\n",
    "do not believe we ought to if we wish to remain consistent; we must\n",
    "rather admit that his mode of grasping the situation violates neither\n",
    "reason nor known mechanical laws. Even though it is being accelerated\n",
    "with respect to the “Galileian space” first considered, we can\n",
    "nevertheless regard the chest as being at rest. We have thus good\n",
    "grounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of\n",
    "reference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a\n",
    "result we have gained a powerful argument for a generalised postulate\n",
    "of relativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must note carefully that the possibility of this mode of\n",
    "interpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitational\n",
    "field of giving all bodies the same acceleration, or, what comes to the\n",
    "same thing, on the law of the equality of inertial and gravitational\n",
    "mass. If this natural law did not exist, the man in the accelerated\n",
    "chest would not be able to interpret the behaviour of the bodies around\n",
    "him on the supposition of a gravitational field, and he would not be\n",
    "justified on the grounds of experience in supposing his reference-body\n",
    "to be “at rest.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that the man in the chest fixes a rope to the inner side of the\n",
    "lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the rope. The\n",
    "result of this will be to stretch the rope so that it will hang\n",
    "“vertically” downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the cause of\n",
    "tension in the rope, the man in the chest will say: “The suspended body\n",
    "experiences a downward force in the gravitational field, and this is\n",
    "neutralised by the tension of the rope; what determines the magnitude\n",
    "of the tension of the rope is the _gravitational mass_ of the suspended\n",
    "body.” On the other hand, an observer who is poised freely in space\n",
    "will interpret the condition of things thus: “The rope must perforce\n",
    "take part in the accelerated motion of the chest, and it transmits this\n",
    "motion to the body attached to it. The tension of the rope is just\n",
    "large enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That which\n",
    "determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the _inertial\n",
    "mass_ of the body.” Guided by this example, we see that our extension\n",
    "of the principle of relativity implies the _necessity_ of the law of\n",
    "the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Thus we have obtained\n",
    "a physical interpretation of this law.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that a general\n",
    "theory of relativity must yield important results on the laws of\n",
    "gravitation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general\n",
    "idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by the gravitational\n",
    "field. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn the reader\n",
    "against a misconception suggested by these considerations. A\n",
    "gravitational field exists for the man in the chest, despite the fact\n",
    "that there was no such field for the co-ordinate system first chosen.\n",
    "Now we might easily suppose that the existence of a gravitational field\n",
    "is always only an _apparent_ one. We might also think that, regardless\n",
    "of the kind of gravitational field which may be present, we could\n",
    "always choose another reference-body such that _no_ gravitational field\n",
    "exists with reference to it. This is by no means true for all\n",
    "gravitational fields, but only for those of quite special form. It is,\n",
    "for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference such that, as\n",
    "judged from it, the gravitational field of the earth (in its entirety)\n",
    "vanishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing, which we\n",
    "brought forward against the general principle of relativity at the end\n",
    "of Section XVIII. It is certainly true that the observer in the railway\n",
    "carriage experiences a jerk forwards as a result of the application of\n",
    "the brake, and that he recognises, in this the non-uniformity of motion\n",
    "(retardation) of the carriage. But he is compelled by nobody to refer\n",
    "this jerk to a “real” acceleration (retardation) of the carriage. He\n",
    "might also interpret his experience thus: “My body of reference (the\n",
    "carriage) remains permanently at rest. With reference to it, however,\n",
    "there exists (during the period of application of the brakes) a\n",
    "gravitational field which is directed forwards and which is variable\n",
    "with respect to time. Under the influence of this field, the embankment\n",
    "together with the earth moves non-uniformly in such a manner that their\n",
    "original velocity in the backwards direction is continuously reduced.”\n",

    "XXI.\n",
    "\n",
    "IN WHAT RESPECTS ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND OF THE\n",
    "SPECIAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY UNSATISFACTORY?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already stated several times that classical mechanics starts\n",
    "out from the following law: Material particles sufficiently far removed\n",
    "from other material particles continue to move uniformly in a straight\n",
    "line or continue in a state of rest. We have also repeatedly emphasised\n",
    "that this fundamental law can only be valid for bodies of reference _K_\n",
    "which possess certain unique states of motion, and which are in uniform\n",
    "translational motion relative to each other. Relative to other\n",
    "reference-bodies _K_ the law is not valid. Both in classical mechanics\n",
    "and in the special theory of relativity we therefore differentiate\n",
    "between reference-bodies _K_ relative to which the recognised “laws of\n",
    "nature” can be said to hold, and reference-bodies _K_ relative to which\n",
    "these laws do not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "But no person whose mode of thought is logical can rest satisfied with\n",
    "this condition of things. He asks: “How does it come that certain\n",
    "reference-bodies (or their states of motion) are given priority over\n",
    "other reference-bodies (or their states of motion)? _What is the reason\n",
    "for this preference?_” In order to show clearly what I mean by this\n",
    "question, I shall make use of a comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am standing in front of a gas range. Standing alongside of each other\n",
    "on the range are two pans so much alike that one may be mistaken for\n",
    "the other. Both are half full of water. I notice that steam is being\n",
    "emitted continuously from the one pan, but not from the other. I am\n",
    "surprised at this, even if I have never seen either a gas range or a\n",
    "pan before. But if I now notice a luminous something of bluish colour\n",
    "under the first pan but not under the other, I cease to be astonished,\n",
    "even if I have never before seen a gas flame. For I can only say that\n",
    "this bluish something will cause the emission of the steam, or at least\n",
    "_possibly_ it may do so. If, however, I notice the bluish something in\n",
    "neither case, and if I observe that the one continuously emits steam\n",
    "whilst the other does not, then I shall remain astonished and\n",
    "dissatisfied until I have discovered some circumstance to which I can\n",
    "attribute the different behaviour of the two pans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogously, I seek in vain for a real something in classical mechanics\n",
    "(or in the special theory of relativity) to which I can attribute the\n",
    "different behaviour of bodies considered with respect to the reference\n",
    "systems _K_ and _K′_.[15] Newton saw this objection and attempted to\n",
    "invalidate it, but without success. But E. Mach recognised it most\n",
    "clearly of all, and because of this objection he claimed that mechanics\n",
    "must be placed on a new basis. It can only be got rid of by means of a\n",
    "physics which is conformable to the general principle of relativity,\n",
    "since the equations of such a theory hold for every body of reference,\n",
    "whatever may be its state of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " [15] The objection is of importance more especially when the state of\n",
    " motion of the reference-body is of such a nature that it does not\n",
    " require any external agency for its maintenance, _e.g._ in the case\n",
    " when the reference-body is rotating uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "XXII.\n",
    "\n",
    "A FEW INFERENCES FROM THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF RELATIVITY\n",
    "\n",
    "The considerations of Section XX show that the general principle of\n",
    "relativity puts us in a position to derive properties of the\n",
    "gravitational field in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose, for\n",
    "instance, that we know the space-time “course” for any natural process\n",
    "whatsoever, as regards the manner in which it takes place in the\n",
    "Galileian domain relative to a Galileian body of reference _K_. By\n",
    "means of purely theoretical operations (_i.e._ simply by calculation)\n",
    "we are then able to find how this known natural process appears, as\n",
    "seen from a reference-body _K′_ which is accelerated relatively to _K_.\n",
    "But since a gravitational field exists with respect to this new body of\n",
    "reference _K′_, our consideration also teaches us how the gravitational\n",
    "field influences the process studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we learn that a body which is in a state of uniform\n",
    "rectilinear motion with respect to _K_ (in accordance with the law of\n",
    "Galilei) is executing an accelerated and in general curvilinear motion\n",
    "with respect to the accelerated reference-body _K′_ (chest). This\n",
    "acceleration or curvature corresponds to the influence on the moving\n",
    "body of the gravitational field prevailing relatively to _K_. It is\n",
    "known that a gravitational field influences the movement of bodies in\n",
    "this way, so that our consideration supplies us with nothing\n",
    "essentially new.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we obtain a new result of fundamental importance when we carry\n",
    "out the analogous consideration for a ray of light. With respect to the\n",
    "Galileian reference-body _K_, such a ray of light is transmitted\n",
    "rectilinearly with the velocity _c_. It can easily be shown that the\n",
    "path of the same ray of light is no longer a straight line when we\n",
    "consider it with reference to the accelerated chest (reference-body\n",
    "_K′_). From this we conclude, _that, in general, rays of light are\n",
    "propagated curvilinearly in gravitational fields._ In two respects this\n",
    "result is of great importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first place, it can be compared with the reality. Although a\n",
    "detailed examination of the question shows that the curvature of light\n",
    "rays required by the general theory of relativity is only exceedingly\n",
    "small for the gravitational fields at our disposal in practice, its\n",
    "estimated magnitude for light rays passing the sun at grazing incidence\n",
    "is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This ought to manifest itself in\n",
    "the following way. As seen from the earth, certain fixed stars appear\n",
    "to be in the neighbourhood of the sun, and are thus capable of\n",
    "observation during a total eclipse of the sun. At such times, these\n",
    "stars ought to appear to be displaced outwards from the sun by an\n",
    "amount indicated above, as compared with their apparent position in the\n",
    "sky when the sun is situated at another part of the heavens. The\n",
    "examination of the correctness or otherwise of this deduction is a\n",
    "problem of the greatest importance, the early solution of which is to\n",
    "be expected of astronomers.[16]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " [16] By means of the star photographs of two expeditions equipped by a\n",
    " Joint Committee of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies, the\n",
    " existence of the deflection of light demanded by theory was first\n",
    " confirmed during the solar eclipse of 29th May, 1919. (Cf. Appendix\n",
    " III.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second place our result shows that, according to the general\n",
    "theory of relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light\n",
    "in vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in\n",
    "the special theory of relativity and to which we have already\n",
    "frequently referred, cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature\n",
    "of rays of light can only take place when the velocity of propagation\n",
    "of light varies with position. Now we might think that as a consequence\n",
    "of this, the special theory of relativity and with it the whole theory\n",
    "of relativity would be laid in the dust. But in reality this is not the\n",
    "case. We can only conclude that the special theory of relativity cannot\n",
    "claim an unlimited domain of validity; its results hold only so long as\n",
    "we are able to disregard the influences of gravitational fields on the\n",
    "phenomena (_e.g._ of light).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it has often been contended by opponents of the theory of\n",
    "relativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown by the\n",
    "general theory of relativity, it is perhaps advisable to make the facts\n",
    "of the case clearer by means of an appropriate comparison. Before the\n",
    "development of electrodynamics the laws of electrostatics were looked\n",
    "upon as the laws of electricity. At the present time we know that\n",
    "electric fields can be derived correctly from electrostatic\n",
    "considerations only for the case, which is never strictly realised, in\n",
    "which the electrical masses are quite at rest relatively to each other,\n",
    "and to the co-ordinate system. Should we be justified in saying that\n",
    "for this reason electrostatics is overthrown by the field-equations of\n",
    "Maxwell in electrodynamics? Not in the least. Electrostatics is\n",
    "contained in electrodynamics as a limiting case; the laws of the latter\n",
    "lead directly to those of the former for the case in which the fields\n",
    "are invariable with regard to time. No fairer destiny could be allotted\n",
    "to any physical theory, than that it should of itself point out the way\n",
    "to the introduction of a more comprehensive theory, in which it lives\n",
    "on as a limiting case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example of the transmission of light just dealt with, we have\n",
    "seen that the general theory of relativity enables us to derive\n",
    "theoretically the influence of a gravitational field on the course of\n",
    "natural processes, the laws of which are already known when a\n",
    "gravitational field is absent. But the most attractive problem, to the\n",
    "solution of which the general theory of relativity supplies the key,\n",
    "concerns the investigation of the laws satisfied by the gravitational\n",
    "field itself. Let us consider this for a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are acquainted with space-time domains which behave (approximately)\n",
    "in a “Galileian” fashion under suitable choice of reference-body,\n",
    "_i.e._ domains in which gravitational fields are absent. If we now\n",
    "refer such a domain to a reference-body _K′_ possessing any kind of\n",
    "motion, then relative to _K′_ there exists a gravitational field which\n",
    "is variable with respect to space and time.[17] The character of this\n",
    "field will of course depend on the motion chosen for _K′._ According to\n",
    "the general theory of relativity, the general law of the gravitational\n",
    "field must be satisfied for all gravitational fields obtainable in this\n",
    "way. Even though by no means all gravitationial fields can be produced\n",
    "in this way, yet we may entertain the hope that the general law of\n",
    "gravitation will be derivable from such gravitational fields of a\n",
    "special kind. This hope has been realised in the most beautiful manner.\n",
    "But between the clear vision of this goal and its actual realisation it\n",
    "was necessary to surmount a serious difficulty, and as this lies deep\n",
    "at the root of things, I dare not withhold it from the reader. We\n",
    "require to extend our ideas of the space-time continuum still farther.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " [17] This follows from a generalisation of the discussion in Section\n",

    "BEHAVIOUR OF CLOCKS AND MEASURING-RODS ON A ROTATING BODY OF REFERENCE\n",
    "\n",
    "Hitherto I have purposely refrained from speaking about the physical\n",
    "interpretation of space- and time-data in the case of the general\n",
    "theory of relativity. As a consequence, I am guilty of a certain\n",
    "slovenliness of treatment, which, as we know from the special theory of\n",
    "relativity, is far from being unimportant and pardonable. It is now\n",
    "high time that we remedy this defect; but I would mention at the\n",
    "outset, that this matter lays no small claims on the patience and on\n",
    "the power of abstraction of the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start off again from quite special cases, which we have frequently\n",
    "used before. Let us consider a space time domain in which no\n",
    "gravitational field exists relative to a reference-body _K_ whose state\n",
    "of motion has been suitably chosen. _K_ is then a Galileian\n",
    "reference-body as regards the domain considered, and the results of the\n",
    "special theory of relativity hold relative to _K_. Let us suppose the\n",
    "same domain referred to a second body of reference _K′_, which is\n",
    "rotating uniformly with respect to _K_. In order to fix our ideas, we\n",
    "shall imagine _K′_ to be in the form of a plane circular disc, which\n",
    "rotates uniformly in its own plane about its centre. An observer who is\n",
    "sitting eccentrically on the disc _K′_ is sensible of a force which\n",
    "acts outwards in a radial direction, and which would be interpreted as\n",
    "an effect of inertia (centrifugal force) by an observer who was at rest\n",
    "with respect to the original reference-body _K_. But the observer on\n",
    "the disc may regard his disc as a reference-body which is “at rest”; on\n",
    "the basis of the general principle of relativity he is justified in\n",
    "doing this. The force acting on himself, and in fact on all other\n",
    "bodies which are at rest relative to the disc, he regards as the effect\n",
    "of a gravitational field. Nevertheless, the space-distribution of this\n",
    "gravitational field is of a kind that would not be possible on Newton’s\n",
    "theory of gravitation.[18] But since the observer believes in the\n",
    "general theory of relativity, this does not disturb him; he is quite in\n",
    "the right when he believes that a general law of gravitation can be\n",
    "formulated—a law which not only explains the motion of the stars\n",
    "correctly, but also the field of force experienced by himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " [18] The field disappears at the centre of the disc and increases\n",
    " proportionally to the distance from the centre as we proceed outwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The observer performs experiments on his circular disc with clocks and\n",
    "measuring-rods. In doing so, it is his intention to arrive at exact\n",
    "definitions for the signification of time- and space-data with\n",
    "reference to the circular disc _K′_, these definitions being based on\n",
    "his observations. What will be his experience in this enterprise?\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with, he places one of two identically constructed clocks at\n",
    "the centre of the circular disc, and the other on the edge of the disc,\n",
    "so that they are at rest relative to it. We now ask ourselves whether\n",
    "both clocks go at the same rate from the standpoint of the non-rotating\n",
    "Galileian reference-body _K_. As judged from this body, the clock at\n",
    "the centre of the disc has no velocity, whereas the clock at the edge\n",
    "of the disc is in motion relative to _K_ in consequence of the\n",
    "rotation. According to a result obtained in Section XII, it follows\n",
    "that the latter clock goes at a rate permanently slower than that of\n",
    "the clock at the centre of the circular disc, _i.e._ as observed from\n",
    "_K_. It is obvious that the same effect would be noted by an observer\n",
    "whom we will imagine sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the\n",
    "circular disc. Thus on our circular disc, or, to make the case more\n",
    "general, in every gravitational field, a clock will go more quickly or\n",
    "less quickly, according to the position in which the clock is situated\n",
    "(at rest). For this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable\n",
    "definition of time with the aid of clocks which are arranged at rest\n",
    "with respect to the body of reference. A similar difficulty presents\n",
    "itself when we attempt to apply our earlier definition of simultaneity\n",
    "in such a case, but I do not wish to go any farther into this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, at this stage the definition of the space co-ordinates also\n",
    "presents insurmountable difficulties. If the observer applies his\n",
    "standard measuring-rod (a rod which is short as compared with the\n",
    "radius of the disc) tangentially to the edge of the disc, then, as\n",
    "judged from the Galileian system, the length of this rod will be less\n",
    "than 1, since, according to Section XII, moving bodies suffer a\n",
    "shortening in the direction of the motion. On the other hand, the\n",
    "measuring-rod will not experience a shortening in length, as judged\n",
    "from _K_, if it is applied to the disc in the direction of the radius.\n",
    "If, then, the observer first measures the circumference of the disc\n",
    "with his measuring-rod and then the diameter of the disc, on dividing\n",
    "the one by the other, he will not obtain as quotient the familiar\n",
    "number π = 3.14 . . ., but a larger number,[19] whereas of course, for\n",
    "a disc which is at rest with respect to _K_, this operation would yield\n",
    "π exactly. This proves that the propositions of Euclidean geometry\n",
    "cannot hold exactly on the rotating disc, nor in general in a\n",
    "gravitational field, at least if we attribute the length 1 to the rod\n",
    "in all positions and in every orientation. Hence the idea of a straight\n",
    "line also loses its meaning. We are therefore not in a position to\n",
    "define exactly the co-ordinates _x, y, z_ relative to the disc by means\n",

    "a system of arbitrary curves (see Fig. 4) drawn on the surface of the\n",
    "table. These we designate as _u_-curves, and we indicate each of them\n",
    "by means of a number. The Curves _u_ = 1, _u_ = 2 and _u_ = 3 are drawn\n",
    "in the diagram. Between the curves _u_ = 1 and _u_ = 2 we must imagine\n",
    "an infinitely large number to be drawn, all of which correspond to real\n",
    "numbers lying between 1 and 2. We have then a system of _u_-curves, and\n",
    "this “infinitely dense” system covers the whole surface of the table.\n",
    "These _u_-curves must not intersect each other, and through each point\n",
    "of the surface one and only one curve must pass. Thus a perfectly\n",
    "definite value of _u_ belongs to every point on the surface of the\n",
    "marble slab. In like manner we imagine a system of _v_-curves drawn on\n",
    "the surface. These satisfy the same conditions as the _u_-curves, they\n",
    "are provided with numbers in a corresponding manner, and they may\n",
    "likewise be of arbitrary shape. It follows that a value of _u_ and a\n",
    "value of _v_ belong to every point on the surface of the table. We call\n",
    "these two numbers the co-ordinates of the surface of the table\n",
    "(Gaussian co-ordinates). For example, the point _P_ in the diagram has\n",

    "case in which the points of the surface considered form a Euclidean\n",

    "However, the Gauss treatment for _ds_2 which we have given above is not\n",
    "always possible. It is only possible when sufficiently small regions of\n",

    "If the reader has followed all our previous considerations, he will\n",
    "have no further difficulty in understanding the methods leading to the\n",
    "solution of the problem of gravitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start off on a consideration of a Galileian domain, _i.e._ a domain\n",
    "in which there is no gravitational field relative to the Galileian\n",
    "reference-body _K_. The behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks with\n",

    "Now let us refer this domain to a random Gauss coordinate system or to\n",

    "a gravitational field _G_ (of a particular kind). We learn the\n",
    "behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks and also of freely-moving\n",
    "material points with reference to _K′_ simply by mathematical\n",
    "transformation. We interpret this behaviour as the behaviour of\n",
    "measuring-rods, clocks and material points under the influence of the\n",
    "gravitational field _G_. Hereupon we introduce a hypothesis: that the\n",
    "influence of the gravitational field on measuring-rods, clocks and\n",
    "freely-moving material points continues to take place according to the\n",
    "same laws, even in the case where the prevailing gravitational field is\n",
    "_not_ derivable from the Galileian special case, simply by means of a\n",
    "transformation of co-ordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to investigate the space-time behaviour of the\n",
    "gravitational field _G_, which was derived from the Galileian special\n",
    "case simply by transformation of the coordinates. This behaviour is\n",
    "formulated in a law, which is always valid, no matter how the\n",
    "reference-body (mollusc) used in the description may be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "This law is not yet the _general_ law of the gravitational field, since\n",
    "the gravitational field under consideration is of a special kind. In\n",
    "order to find out the general law-of-field of gravitation we still\n",
    "require to obtain a generalisation of the law as found above. This can\n",
    "be obtained without caprice, however, by taking into consideration the\n",
    "following demands:\n",
    "\n",
    "(_a_) The required generalisation must likewise satisfy the general\n",
    "postulate of relativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(_b_) If there is any matter in the domain under consideration, only\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(_c_) Gravitational field and matter together must satisfy the law of\n",
    "the conservation of energy (and of impulse).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the general principle of relativity permits us to determine\n",
    "the influence of the gravitational field on the course of all those\n",
    "processes which take place according to known laws when a gravitational\n",
    "field is absent _i.e._ which have already been fitted into the frame of\n",
    "the special theory of relativity. In this connection we proceed in\n",
    "principle according to the method which has already been explained for\n",
    "measuring-rods, clocks and freely moving material points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory of gravitation derived in this way from the general\n",
    "postulate of relativity excels not only in its beauty; nor in removing\n",
    "the defect attaching to classical mechanics which was brought to light\n",
    "in Section XXI; nor in interpreting the empirical law of the equality\n",
    "of inertial and gravitational mass; but it has also already explained a\n",
    "result of observation in astronomy, against which classical mechanics\n",
    "is powerless.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we confine the application of the theory to the case where the\n",
    "gravitational fields can be regarded as being weak, and in which all\n",
    "masses move with respect to the coordinate system with velocities which\n",
    "are small compared with the velocity of light, we then obtain as a\n",
    "first approximation the Newtonian theory. Thus the latter theory is\n",
    "obtained here without any particular assumption, whereas Newton had to\n",
    "introduce the hypothesis that the force of attraction between mutually\n",
    "attracting material points is inversely proportional to the square of\n",
    "the distance between them. If we increase the accuracy of the\n",
    "calculation, deviations from the theory of Newton make their\n",
    "appearance, practically all of which must nevertheless escape the test\n",
    "of observation owing to their smallness.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must draw attention here to one of these deviations. According to\n",
    "Newton’s theory, a planet moves round the sun in an ellipse, which\n",
    "would permanently maintain its position with respect to the fixed\n",
    "stars, if we could disregard the motion of the fixed stars themselves\n",
    "and the action of the other planets under consideration. Thus, if we\n",
    "correct the observed motion of the planets for these two influences,\n",
    "and if Newton’s theory be strictly correct, we ought to obtain for the\n",
    "orbit of the planet an ellipse, which is fixed with reference to the\n",
    "fixed stars. This deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy,\n",
    "has been confirmed for all the planets save one, with the precision\n",
    "that is capable of being obtained by the delicacy of observation\n",
    "attainable at the present time. The sole exception is Mercury, the\n",
    "planet which lies nearest the sun. Since the time of Leverrier, it has\n",
    "been known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit of Mercury,\n",
    "after it has been corrected for the influences mentioned above, is not\n",
    "stationary with respect to the fixed stars, but that it rotates\n",
    "exceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit and in the sense of the\n",
    "orbital motion. The value obtained for this rotary movement of the\n",
    "orbital ellipse was 43 seconds of arc per century, an amount ensured to\n",
    "be correct to within a few seconds of arc. This effect can be explained\n",
    "by means of classical mechanics only on the assumption of hypotheses\n",
    "which have little probability, and which were devised solely for this\n",
    "purponse.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the basis of the general theory of relativity, it is found that the\n",
    "ellipse of every planet round the sun must necessarily rotate in the\n",
    "manner indicated above; that for all the planets, with the exception of\n",
    "Mercury, this rotation is too small to be detected with the delicacy of\n",
    "observation possible at the present time; but that in the case of\n",
    "Mercury it must amount to 43 seconds of arc per century, a result which\n",
    "is strictly in agreement with observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from this one, it has hitherto been possible to make only two\n",

    "COSMOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES OF NEWTON’S THEORY\n",
    "\n",
    "Part from the difficulty discussed in Section XXI, there is a second\n",
    "fundamental difficulty attending classical celestial mechanics, which,\n",
    "to the best of my knowledge, was first discussed in detail by the\n",
    "astronomer Seeliger. If we ponder over the question as to how the\n",
    "universe, considered as a whole, is to be regarded, the first answer\n",
    "that suggests itself to us is surely this: As regards space (and time)\n",
    "the universe is infinite. There are stars everywhere, so that the\n",
    "density of matter, although very variable in detail, is nevertheless on\n",
    "the average everywhere the same. In other words: However far we might\n",
    "travel through space, we should find everywhere an attenuated swarm of\n",
    "fixed stars of approrimately the same kind and density.\n",
    "\n",
    "This view is not in harmony with the theory of Newton. The latter\n",
    "theory rather requires that the universe should have a kind of centre\n",
    "in which the density of the stars is a maximum, and that as we proceed\n",
    "outwards from this centre the group-density of the stars should\n",
    "diminish, until finally, at great distances, it is succeeded by an\n",
    "infinite region of emptiness. The stellar universe ought to be a finite\n",
    "island in the infinite ocean of space.[24]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " [24] _Proof_—According to the theory of Newton, the number of “lines\n",
    " of force” which come from infinity and terminate in a mass m is\n",
    " proportional to the mass _m_. If, on the average, the mass density ρ0\n",
    " is constant throughout the universe, then a sphere of volume _V_ will\n",
    " enclose the average man ρ0_V_. Thus the number of lines of force\n",
    " passing through the surface _F_ of the sphere into its interior is\n",
    " proportional to ρ0_V_. For unit area of the surface of the sphere the\n",
    " number of lines of force which enters the sphere is thus proportional\n",
    " to ρ0_V/F_ or to ρ0_R_. Hence the intensity of the field at the\n",
    " surface would ultimately become infinite with increasing radius _R_ of\n",
    " the sphere, which is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This conception is in itself not very satisfactory. It is still less\n",
    "satisfactory because it leads to the result that the light emitted by\n",
    "the stars and also individual stars of the stellar system are\n",
    "perpetually passing out into infinite space, never to return, and\n",
    "without ever again coming into interaction with other objects of\n",
    "nature. Such a finite material universe would be destined to become\n",
    "gradually but systematically impoverished.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to escape this dilemma, Seeliger suggested a modification of\n",
    "Newton’s law, in which he assumes that for great distances the force of\n",
    "attraction between two masses diminishes more rapidly than would result\n",
    "from the inverse square law. In this way it is possible for the mean\n",
    "density of matter to be constant everywhere, even to infinity, without\n",
    "infinitely large gravitational fields being produced. We thus free\n",
    "ourselves from the distasteful conception that the material universe\n",
    "ought to possess something of the nature of a centre. Of course we\n",
    "purchase our emancipation from the fundamental difficulties mentioned,\n",
    "at the cost of a modification and complication of Newton’s law which\n",
    "has neither empirical nor theoretical foundation. We can imagine\n",
    "innumerable laws which would serve the same purpose, without our being\n",
    "able to state a reason why one of them is to be preferred to the\n",

    "with experience (Riemann, Helmholtz). These questions have already been\n",
    "treated in detail and with unsurpassable lucidity by Helmholtz and\n",
    "Poincar, whereas I can only touch on them briefly here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first place, we imagine an existence in two dimensional space.\n",
    "Flat beings with flat implements, and in particular flat rigid\n",
    "measuring-rods, are free to move in a _plane_. For them nothing exists\n",
    "outside of this plane: that which they observe to happen to themselves\n",
    "and to their flat “things” is the all-inclusive reality of their plane.\n",
    "In particular, the constructions of plane Euclidean geometry can be\n",
    "carried out by means of the rods _e.g._ the lattice construction,\n",
    "considered in Section XXIV. In contrast to ours, the universe of these\n",
    "beings is two-dimensional; but, like ours, it extends to infinity. In\n",
    "their universe there is room for an infinite number of identical\n",
    "squares made up of rods, _i.e._ its volume (surface) is infinite. If\n",
    "these beings say their universe is “plane,” there is sense in the\n",
    "statement, because they mean that they can perform the constructions of\n",
    "plane Euclidean geometry with their rods. In this connection the\n",
    "individual rods always represent the same distance, independently of\n",
    "their position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider now a second two-dimensional existence, but this time\n",
    "on a spherical surface instead of on a plane. The flat beings with\n",
    "their measuring-rods and other objects fit exactly on this surface and\n",
    "they are unable to leave it. Their whole universe of observation\n",
    "extends exclusively over the surface of the sphere. Are these beings\n",
    "able to regard the geometry of their universe as being plane geometry\n",
    "and their rods withal as the realisation of “distance”? They cannot do\n",
    "this. For if they attempt to realise a straight line, they will obtain\n",
    "a curve, which we “three-dimensional beings” designate as a great\n",
    "circle, _i.e._ a self-contained line of definite finite length, which\n",
    "can be measured up by means of a measuring-rod. Similarly, this\n",
    "universe has a finite area that can be compared with the area, of a\n",
    "square constructed with rods. The great charm resulting from this\n",
    "consideration lies in the recognition of the fact that _the universe of\n",
    "these beings is finite and yet has no limits._\n",
    "\n",
    "But the spherical-surface beings do not need to go on a world-tour in\n",
    "order to perceive that they are not living in a Euclidean universe.\n",
    "They can convince themselves of this on every part of their “world,”\n",
    "provided they do not use too small a piece of it. Starting from a\n",
    "point, they draw “straight lines” (arcs of circles as judged in three\n",
    "dimensional space) of equal length in all directions. They will call\n",
    "the line joining the free ends of these lines a “circle.” For a plane\n",
    "surface, the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter,\n",
    "both lengths being measured with the same rod, is, according to\n",
    "Euclidean geometry of the plane, equal to a constant value π, which is\n",
    "independent of the diameter of the circle. On their spherical surface\n",
    "our flat beings would find for this ratio the value\n",
    "\n",
    "image036\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "_i.e._ a smaller value than π, the difference being the more\n",
    "considerable, the greater is the radius of the circle in comparison\n",
    "with the radius _R_ of the “world-sphere.” By means of this relation\n",
    "the spherical beings can determine the radius of their universe\n",
    "(“world”), even when only a relatively small part of their worldsphere\n",
    "is available for their measurements. But if this part is very small\n",
    "indeed, they will no longer be able to demonstrate that they are on a\n",
    "spherical “world” and not on a Euclidean plane, for a small part of a\n",
    "spherical surface differs only slightly from a piece of a plane of the\n",
    "same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus if the spherical surface beings are living on a planet of which\n",
    "the solar system occupies only a negligibly small part of the spherical\n",

    "a finite or in an infinite universe, because the “piece of universe” to\n",
    "which they have access is in both cases practically plane, or\n",
    "Euclidean. It follows directly from this discussion, that for our\n",
    "sphere-beings the circumference of a circle first increases with the\n",
    "radius until the “circumference of the universe” is reached, and that\n",
    "it thenceforward gradually decreases to zero for still further\n",
    "increasing values of the radius. During this process the area of the\n",
    "circle continues to increase more and more, until finally it becomes\n",
    "equal to the total area of the whole “world-sphere.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the reader will wonder why we have placed our “beings” on a\n",
    "sphere rather than on another closed surface. But this choice has its\n",
    "justification in the fact that, of all closed surfaces, the sphere is\n",
    "unique in possessing the property that all points on it are equivalent.\n",
    "I admit that the ratio of the circumference _c_ of a circle to its\n",
    "radius _r_ depends on _r_, but for a given value of _r_ it is the same\n",
    "for all points of the “worldsphere”; in other words, the “world-sphere”\n",
    "is a “surface of constant curvature.”\n",
    "\n",
    "To this two-dimensional sphere-universe there is a three-dimensional\n",
    "analogy, namely, the three-dimensional spherical space which was\n",
    "discovered by Riemann. its points are likewise all equivalent. It\n",
    "possesses a finite volume, which is determined by its “radius”\n",
    "(2π2_R_3). Is it possible to imagine a spherical space? To imagine a\n",
    "space means nothing else than that we imagine an epitome of our “space”\n",
    "experience, _i.e._ of experience that we can have in the movement of\n",
    "“rigid” bodies. In this sense we _can_ imagine a spherical space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we draw lines or stretch strings in all directions from a\n",
    "point, and mark off from each of these the distance _r_ with a\n",
    "measuring-rod. All the free end-points of these lengths lie on a\n",
    "spherical surface. We can specially measure up the area (_F_) of this\n",
    "surface by means of a square made up of measuring-rods. If the universe\n",
    "is Euclidean, then _F_ = 4π_r_2; if it is spherical, then _F_ is always\n",
    "less than 4π_r_2. With increasing values of _r, F_ increases from zero\n",
    "up to a maximum value which is determined by the “world-radius,” but\n",
    "for still further increasing values of _r_, the area gradually\n",
    "diminishes to zero. At first, the straight lines which radiate from the\n",
    "starting point diverge farther and farther from one another, but later\n",
    "they approach each other, and finally they run together again at a\n",
    "“counter-point” to the starting point. Under such conditions they have\n",
    "traversed the whole spherical space. It is easily seen that the\n",
    "three-dimensional spherical space is quite analogous to the\n",
    "two-dimensional spherical surface. It is finite (_i.e._ of finite\n",
    "volume), and has no bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be mentioned that there is yet another kind of curved space:\n",
    "“elliptical space.” It can be regarded as a curved space in which the\n",

    "An elliptical universe can thus be considered to some extent as a\n",
    "curved universe possessing central symmetry.\n",

    "equivalent. As a result of this discussion, a most interesting question\n",
    "arises for astronomers and physicists, and that is whether the universe\n",

    "THE STRUCTURE OF SPACE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL THEORY OF RELATIVITY\n",
    "\n",
    "(SUPPLEMENTARY TO SECTION XXXII)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the publication of the first edition of this little book, our\n",
    "knowledge about the structure of space in the large (“cosmological\n",
    "problem”) has had an important development, which ought to be mentioned\n",
    "even in a popular presentation of the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "My original considerations on the subject were based on two hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) There exists an average density of matter in the whole of space\n",
    "which is everywhere the same and different from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) The magnitude (“radius”) of space is independent of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these hypotheses proved to be consistent, according to the general\n",
    "theory of relativity, but only after a hypothetical term was added to\n",
    "the field equations, a term which was not required by the theory as\n",
    "such nor did it seem natural from a theoretical point of view\n",
    "(“cosmological term of the field equations”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis (2) appeared unavoidable to me at the time, since I thought\n",
    "that one would get into bottomless speculations if one departed from\n",
    "it.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, already in the ’twenties, the Russian mathematician Friedman\n",
    "showed that a different hypothesis was natural from a purely\n",
    "theoretical point of view. He realized that it was possible to preserve\n",
    "hypothesis (1) without introducing the less natural cosmological term\n",
    "into the field equations of gravitation, if one was ready to drop\n",
    "hypothesis (2). Namely, the original field equations admit a solution\n",
    "in which the “world radius” depends on time (expanding space). In that\n",
    "sense one can say, according to Friedman, that the theory demands an\n",
    "expansion of space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few years later Hubble showed, by a special investigation of the\n",
    "extra-galactic nebulae (“milky ways”), that the spectral lines emitted\n",
    "showed a red shift which increased regularly with the distance of the\n",
    "nebulae. This can be interpreted in regard to our present knowledge\n",
    "only in the sense of Doppler’s principle, as an expansive motion of the\n",
    "system of stars in the large—as required, according to Friedman, by the\n",
    "field equations of gravitation. Hubble’s discovery can, therefore, be\n",
    "considered to some extent as a confirmation of the theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "There does arise, however, a strange difficulty. The interpretation of\n",
    "the galactic line-shift discovered by Hubble as an expansion (which can\n",
    "hardly be doubted from a theoretical point of view), leads to an origin\n",
    "of this expansion which lies “only” about 109 years ago, while physical\n",
    "astronomy makes it appear likely that the development of individual\n",
    "stars and systems of stars takes considerably longer. It is in no way\n",
    "known how this incongruity is to be overcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "I further want to remark that the theory of expanding space, together\n",
    "with the empirical data of astronomy, permit no decision to be reached\n",
